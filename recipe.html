        <p class="textgrey">"No more dry, lackluster burgers. These are juicy, and spices
            can be easily added or changed to suit anyone's taste.
            Baste frequently with your favorite barbeque sauce. 
            If you find the meat mixture too mushy, just add more bread crumbs 
            until it forms patties that hold their shape."

    <li>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Place a roasting rack on
        foiled-lined baking sheet.
    </li>
    <li>Using your hands, break the meat into small pieces and combine
        evenly but loosely on parchment or waxed paper-lined baking sheet.
        Spread the meat out and season it generously with salt, pepper.
        If desired, add the spice mix at this time. 
    </li>
    <li>Dived the meat into 4 portions (about 6 ounces each). Using your
        hands, form each portion into a ball-shape by gently tossing it form
        1 hand to the other. (Don't over work or press too firmly on the meat.)
        Gently form each portion into a patty about 3/4-inches wide ad 1-inch thick.

    <li>Preheat a large cast iron skillet over medium-low heat for 5 minutes.
        Raise the heat to high and add the oil. Add the patties and cook,
        turning once, until well-browned, about 2 minutes each side.
    </li>

         in the oven and continue cooking to desired doneness, 8 to 9 minutes
        for medium-rare, 10 to 11 minutes for medium, and 13 to 15 minutes

        their last couple of minutes of cooking to melt</li>

        before serving. Meanwhile, toast the hamburger buns. Assemble the 
        hamburgers with the condiments and toppings of your choice.
        Serve.
